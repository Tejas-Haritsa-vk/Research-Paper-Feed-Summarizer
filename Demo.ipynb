Beyond\\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io',\n",

We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning\\npipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM\\nutilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion\\nstrategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based\\nfilter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating\\nhuman-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which\\nstarkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce\\nbanned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in\\nblacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming\\nperformance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as\\nwell as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to\\nunseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs\\n(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).',\n",

Thanks to advances in diffusion [75, 7, 84] and autoregressive [36,\\n76, 16] architectures, current video models can produce high-fidelity videos maintaining consistent\\nobject relations and realistic motion dynamics across frames. This suggests that the models may\\nhave internalized substantial visual and structural knowledge about the world. Recent research from\\nGoogle [70] further hints that, such models are evolving beyond pure content generation: Veo-3 [21]\\nhas been shown to perform dozens of distinct vision tasks across perception, modeling, manipulation,\\nand reasoning, without any task-specific training. These emergent capabilities have led researchers to\\nposit that video models could serve as unified, generalist vision models, much like large language\\nmodels (LLMs) [1, 13, 3, 30] have become foundation models for natural language.\\nCrucially, the sequential nature of video generation provides a new perspective on how such models\\nmight reason. Each generated frame builds upon the last, creating a temporal chain of information\\npropagation. This has been dubbed “Chain-of-Frame” (CoF) reasoning [70], an analogy to the chain-\\nof-thought (CoT) process in LLMs [69, 35, 82, 23, 79] and their multi-modal variants (MLLMs) [12,\\n4, 40, 31, 10]. In essence, as a video model generates a sequence of frames, it can iteratively refine\\nand update the scene, thereby working through a problem step-by-step in time and space. This CoF\\nconcept suggests that, beyond surface-level pattern generation, general-purpose visual reasoning may\\nemerge from video generative models.\\narXiv:2510.26802v1  [cs.CV]  30 Oct 2025'),\n",

We investigate\\nwhether state-of-the-art video models exhibit emergent reasoning potentials beyond content synthesis.\\nThe analysis spans 12 reasoning dimensions under a unified perspective, exploring whether large-scale\\nvideo models can serve as zero-shot visual reasoners via CoF reasoning.\\nHowever, it remains unclear to what extent current video models truly exhibit reasoning about the\\ncontent they create. Strong generative performance does not automatically imply robust reasoning\\npotential. Emerging evidence [22, 47, 5, 78] shows that a model may produce coherent videos by\\nlearning surface-level patterns in the training data, rather than by internalizing general principles. For\\ninstance, a video model can maintain object continuity yet fail to grasp physical plausibility across\\na long sequence, or it may mimic observed visual sequences without understanding the underlying\\ncause-and-effect relationships. This motivates our central question: Are video models, purely through\\nlarge-scale visual learning, obtain the zero-shot reasoning potential?\\nTo this end, we present the first empirical study to systematically probe the CoF reasoning capabili-\\nties of modern video models, spanning 12 dimensions such as spatial, geometric, physical, temporal,\\nand embodied logic, as detailed in 1. We carry out our analysis on Veo-3, which has been system-\\natically examined as a zero-shot learner in prior work [70]. Our preliminary observations suggest\\nthat current leading video models exhibit comparable reasoning patterns, making Veo-3 a represen-\\ntative choice. Our analysis builds on reasoning scenarios distilled from diverse reasoning-oriented\\nbenchmarks [25, 67, 45, 71, 29, 34], as well as those we design ourselves, providing a compact yet\\nexpressive foundation. The prompts for video models are meticulously crafted by transforming the\\nunderlying, textual reasoning process of problem-solving into a clear, video-presentation format.\\nEach case receives a qualitative assessment across three performance levels, i.e., good, moderate, and\\nbad, complemented by a quantitative success rate to measure robustness.\\nTo standardize evaluation, we curate these tasks into the MME-COF benchmark, as illustrated in\\nFigure 2 and Section 3.2. Leveraging this benchmark, we measure several state-of-the-art video\\nmodels, i.e., Veo-3 [21], Sora-2 [56], Kling [38], and Seedance [19], to obtain directly comparable\\nscores and qualitative behaviors across categories.

For each reasoning case, the experts manually constructed text prompts that\\nexplicitly or unambiguously define the target reasoning objective, aiming to evaluate the potential of\\nvideo models for multi-modal reasoning.\\nPrompt Design Style.\\nTo ensure consistency and fairness, all prompts follow a unified style\\nemphasizing explicit visual constraints, controlled motion, and minimal linguistic ambiguity. Prompts\\nare encouraged to be written in imperative form and designed to reduce variance from language\\ninterpretation, focusing the model’s behavior on the intended visual reasoning objective. The overall\\ndesign principles are as follows:\\n1) Static camera and fixed viewpoint, unless motion is explicitly required by the task.\\n2) Stable spatial composition, consistent framing, and unchanging scene layout across\\nframes.\\n3) Clear specification of allowed and disallowed changes (e.g., “no zoom, no pan, no dolly”)\\nto constrain camera dynamics.\\n4) Explicit temporal phrasing to control the pace of motion, using cues such as “instantly”,\\n“smoothly”, or “step-by-step”.\\n5) Avoidance of direct textual hints toward the answer; instructions are purely visual and\\ntask-oriented.\\n6) Inclusion of realistic phrasing and scene context to align with the model’s natural video\\npriors while minimizing artifacts.\\nThe standardized prompt style ensures that differences in output primarily reflect the model’s internal\\nreasoning potential rather than prompt variability.\\nAnalysis Setup.\\nFor every reasoning case, we construct a text prompt that explicitly or implicitly\\nspecifies the target reasoning objective. Each prompt produces six video samples at a resolution of\\n1280×720, 24 FPS, and a duration of 8 seconds. All experiments are conducted in a unified zero-shot\\nsetup without fine-tuning, additional supervision, or auxiliary tools.\\nWe evaluate model outputs through qualitative judgments along three levels of performance, i.e.,\\nGood , Moderate , and Bad, based on the clarity, correctness, and temporal stability of the visual\\nreasoning process. Detailed definitions and examples of these evaluation criteria are provided in the\\ncorresponding task subsections. Note that, since we observe that most video models struggle to follow\\nthe requirement of ‘static shot’ reliably, we apply more permissive qualitative criteria for static-shot\\nevaluations. We further define a success rate to measure robustness across generations for each case,\\ncomputed as the proportion of successful samples among the six generated. For cases categorized as\\nBad, the success rate is always 0. Non-zero success rates only appear in cases evaluated as Good or\\nModerate , indicating that Veo-3 exhibits some potential to perform as a visual reasoner.

It covers attribute recognition, e.g., identifying color, texture or\\nmaterial of an object, and spatial relation identification, e.g., recognizing that one object is on the\\nleft of or behind another object. The model is evaluated on the capacity both to attend to the correct\\ntarget region and to maintain visual consistency, across frames, of the attribute or relation in question.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe define the three-level evaluation criteria as follows:\\n✓Good: The reasoning video accurately centers on the correct target region, clearly resolves\\nthe relevant attribute, such as color, texture or position, and maintains sharp, stable and natural\\nrendering throughout the sequence. There are no visible frame drops, artifacts or unintended\\nmotion.\\n~ Moderate: The region of interest is approximately correct, and the attribute remains\\ninferable, but the sequence suffers from minor blur, incomplete framing, slight instability\\nmild unnatural motion, or sometimes deviates from the textual instruction and produces a\\nplausible but unaligned or self-directed visual interpretation, limiting confident interpretation.\\n✗Bad: The target region is incorrect or ambiguous, the attribute cannot be reliably inferred,\\nor the video exhibits severe artifacts: abrupt frame jumps, major jitter, unintended zoom or\\ncrop, extraneous objects interfering, or conspicuous quality degradation that obstructs the\\nreasoning task altogether.\\nData Source.\\nWe sample data from the V∗Bench [71], which provides a comprehensive set of\\nevaluation dimensions including spatial relationship and color/attribute consistency tasks.\\nExample and Analysis.\\nWe illustrate typical behaviors of Veo-3 in visual detail reasoning through\\nfour representative cases in Figure 3. In case I, the model performs well in localizing the target:\\nalthough it does not strictly execute the “zoom in” instruction, it instead achieves an equivalent\\nvisual outcome through a semantically consistent motion with a person’s hand. This slight deviation\\nsuggests that the model may exhibit certain generation preferences in how it interprets and realizes\\nspatial instructions, possibly reflecting stylistic tendencies learned from training data. In cases II\\nand III, the model achieves better success rates when the targets are visually salient and contextually\\ndistinct. For the handbag and dog-motorcycle scenes, Veo-3 attends to the correct regions and\\nmaintains smooth temporal coherence. However, when the object (e.g., the motorcycle) is small or\\nsurrounded by distracting elements, the model occasionally fails to locate it accurately, indicating\\nlimited fine-grained spatial discrimination in cluttered scenes. In case IV, when the target object is\\ntiny and visually indistinct, Veo-3 cannot identify it even with explicit positional hints, highlighting\\nthat the model’s perceptual grounding and reasoning weaken sharply when object size and salience\\nare too low for reliable attention.\\nTakeaway 1\\nVeo-3 performs well in fine-grained attribute and spatial reasoning for salient, well-grounded\\ntargets, but fails when objects are small, occluded, or cluttered. It sometimes exhibits stylistic\\ngeneration biases that lead to plausible yet instruction-divergent outcomes.\\n2.3\\nVisual Trace Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nThe visual trace reasoning category evaluates a model’s\\nability to represent and maintain causal continuity across sequential actions. Typical tasks include\\nmaze navigation, path following, and multi-step object manipulation, where the video must visually\\nencode a coherent sequence of intermediate decisions that lead to the correct goal. Performance is\\nassessed based on two major aspects: (i) temporal coherence, which is the smoothness and logical\\n6'),\n",

In case I, the model repeatedly fails to execute the exact step sequence and instead drifts\\ntoward a visually salient central cell. However, case II is one of the few successes: the model can\\nproduce a coherent step-by-step path in simple, low-branching settings, but this behavior is not\\nrobust across trials. Case III largely fails, where the model often does not ground the specified object\\n(printer), sometimes hallucinating its appearance or placement rather than performing a consistent\\npickup-and-place. Case IV shows near-uniform failure on long-horizon, highly branched navigation:\\noutputs contain wrong turns, discontinuities, and no faithful global plan. Case V reveals difficulty\\ngrounding abstract movement rules, producing inconsistent arrow trajectories. Case VI produces\\nvisually plausible motions along individual paths but fails to preserve or present the comparative\\ninformation required for contrastive reasoning. Taken together, these examples indicate that the\\nmodel can simulate locally coherent short traces but systematically fails at long-horizon planning,\\nrule-grounded execution, and object-persistent manipulations.\\nTakeaway 2\\nVeo-3 can produce locally coherent, short-horizon trace animations in simple, low-branching\\nscenarios, but it does not reliably execute long-horizon plans or rule-grounded sequences.\\n2.4\\nReal-World Spatial Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nThis task investigates Veo-3 [21]’s ability to perceive\\nand maintain spatial relations within natural scenes, with a focus on reasoning about viewpoint change,\\norientation consistency, and reference-frame alignment. We assess whether the model preserves a\\nstable global coordinate frame and coherent scene orientation under varying viewpoints, and whether\\nobjects retain correct relative positions and orientations with respect to each other across different\\nviews.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe define the evaluation criteria in three levels:\\n✓Good: Scene orientation, reference frame, and viewpoint are consistent and correctly\\nrepresent spatial relations. The camera remains steady and the motion is natural.\\n~ Moderate: Scene roughly matches the instruction but contains small perspective errors,\\nunnatural transitions, or partial mirroring. Motion remains interpretable but not physically\\ncoherent.\\n✗Bad: Reference frame or direction is wrong; viewpoint shifts abruptly or inconsistently.\\nVideo suffers from strong camera drift, disorienting motion, or spatial chaos.\\nData Source.\\nTo evaluate on orientation and layout reasoning, we specifically sample data from\\nMMSI-Bench [74]. Also, the tasks of perspective taking and spatial interaction are selected from the\\nOmniSpatial dataset [29].\\nExample and Analysis.\\nAs shown in Figure 6, Veo-3 can correctly handle basic spatial layouts\\nin case I, but struggles with complex viewpoints or orientation changes in case II. The perspective\\ntransformations are sometimes inaccurate or even incorrect, suggesting that the model tends to\\nprioritize visual plausibility over precise spatial reasoning, which hinders further reasoning in case IV.\\nMoreover, case III demonstrates that Veo-3 has difficulty understanding depth, further limiting its\\nspatial reasoning capability.\\nTakeaway 3\\nWhile Veo-3 exhibits an emerging ability for simple real-world spatial reasoning, its capability\\nremains insufficient for handling more complex spatial understanding tasks.\\n9'),\n",

These\\ntasks involve drawing geometric relations by connecting points, adding auxiliary lines, and moving\\ngeometric shapes. The evaluation focuses on whether the generated constructions or movements\\naccurately reflect the described geometric relationships and adhere to the given instructions, while\\nmaintaining smooth, stable operations that ensure visual clarity and coherence throughout the process.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe rate the performance according to the following criteria:\\n✓Good: Constructions and movements are geometrically accurate and visually smooth.\\nEndpoints, intersections, angles, and motion trajectories align correctly with the instructions.\\nBoth drawing and movement processes are stable, fluid, and natural, resembling human\\nsketching or manipulation.\\n~ Moderate: Constructions and movements roughly follow the intended geometry but exhibit\\nminor inaccuracies in line placement, shape alignment, trajectory, or smoothness. Some local\\njitter or abrupt motion may appear, but the overall structure and motion remain interpretable.\\n✗Bad: Constructions or movements deviate substantially from geometric correctness. Lines\\nor shapes may be misplaced, disconnected, or moved in a chaotic or discontinuous manner\\n(e.g., jittering, overlapping, or distorted paths), leading to visual instability and loss of\\ninterpretability.\\nData Source.\\nThe evaluation data are drawn from multiple established sources, including the\\nGeo170k dataset [18], the VarsityTutors subset of Math-PUMA [85] dataset, the line-connection\\nsubset of RBench-V [25], the MAVIS-Gen [80], Tangram Puzzle subsets of the STARE [43] benchmark,\\nand data from VAT [46].\\nExample and Analysis.\\nThe representative examples of the 2D geometry reasoning task are\\npresented in Figures 9 and 10. Veo-3 demonstrates a foundational capability for simple geometric\\nconnection tasks, correctly identifying and linking elements in straightforward scenarios like in case\\nIII. However, this basic competence is inconsistent. The model often prioritizes producing visually\\nsymmetric or semantically meaningful patterns rather than strictly adhering to geometric instructions\\n(cases I and II). Furthermore, case II reveals instances where the model unintentionally modifies the\\noriginal figures, indicating a limited awareness of geometric constraints and poor spatial consistency.\\nWhen tackling more complex connection tasks, the model frequently fails to interpret the intended\\ndrawing order or point indices, resulting in incorrect connection sequences, as demonstrated in cases\\nV, VI, and VII. This is often coupled with an inability to control task termination, as the model tends\\nto continue drawing beyond the required constructions. Finally, for tasks involving the movement\\nof geometric shapes in cases IV and VIII, the model struggles to maintain geometric structural\\nconsistency throughout the motion.\\nTakeaway 6\\nVeo-3 shows initial 2D geometric reasoning ability but still falls short of consistent, constraint-\\naware geometric understanding, remaining far from a robust geometric reasoner.\\n13'),\n",

Tasks in this group involve gravity, collisions, reflection, momentum, or\\nenergy conservation, requiring the model to generate physically plausible and temporally coherent\\nmotion. Evaluation focuses on two complementary aspects: (i) physical plausibility, which means\\nwhether the simulated motion obeys common physical principles; and (ii) causal correctness, which is\\nwhether object interactions are consistent with the underlying cause-and-effect relationships described\\nin the prompt.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe rate the performance according to the following criteria:\\n✓Good: The motion sequence adheres to physical laws such as gravity, momentum, and\\nenergy conservation. Object interactions are realistic and temporally smooth, and the visual\\noutcome remains coherent and credible throughout.\\n~ Moderate: The physical relations are approximately correct but include minor inconsisten-\\ncies, such as irregular acceleration, timing mismatch, or slight violation of conservation. The\\noverall motion remains interpretable and visually plausible.\\n✗Bad: The motion is physically implausible or visually chaotic—objects float, stop abruptly,\\nor behave contrary to basic causal principles. Severe artifacts or temporal discontinuities\\ndisrupt the perception of a coherent physical process.\\nData Source.\\nWe draw samples from MMMU [77], ScienceQA [49], and related physical reasoning\\nsubsets of RBench-V [26] and SpatialViz-Bench [66], covering scenarios such as object collisions,\\npendulum motion, frictional sliding, and optical or magnetic interactions.\\nExample and Analysis.\\nFigure 11 presents four representative physics tasks and their outputs.\\nCase I shows that the model can produce a visually coherent slide, but the behavior violates basic\\nphysical laws. Case II is the most reliable, where reflections and general trajectory shape are rendered\\nplausibly and the task attains a high success rate, although small angular or timing offsets are common.\\nIn case III, the model conveys attraction through motion, yet the depicted dynamics do not reliably\\ntrack the intended force magnitudes or causal ordering. Finally, case IV exposes structural failures,\\nincorrect meshing, inconsistent relative rotations, and nonphysical contact behavior occur frequently,\\nso the mechanical constraints are not respected. Overall, the model can synthesize locally plausible\\ndynamics and handle simple reflection rules, but it fails to maintain quantitative physical constraints\\nand causal fidelity in frictional, force-driven, or mechanically constrained scenarios.\\nTakeaway 7\\nVeo-3 often generates visually plausible short-term dynamics, but it systematically fails to\\npreserve quantitative physical constraints (energy, momentum), causal ordering, and contact\\nmechanics in frictional, force-driven, or mechanically constrained scenarios. Thus, its outputs\\nare somewhat useful for qualitative illustration but are not reliable for quantitative physics\\ninference or causal prediction.\\n2.8\\nRotation Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nThe rotation reasoning task assesses the ability to\\nreason about planar object rotation and maintain consistent spatial grounding under rotational\\ntransformations, thereby supporting subsequent reasoning processes. In each instance, the model is\\nrequired to accurately rotate target objects within a fixed 2D plane while preserving the overall scene\\nstructure and structural consistency, followed by performing reasoning tasks like grounding and OCR.\\nThe evaluation focuses on both the accuracy of the rotation in terms of angle and direction, and the\\nprecision of the resulting reasoning tasks.\\n17'),\n",

The following reasoning tasks are completed correctly. Target\\nobjects remain precisely grounded after rotation.\\n~ Moderate: The rotation is largely correct but may be incomplete or slightly off-angle,\\nthough still confined to the 2D plane. The following reasoning tasks are mostly completed.\\nMinor temporal or visual inconsistencies may appear, but do not alter the core 2D structure or\\nobject grounding.\\n✗Bad: The model fails to perform the correct rotation, extends the transformation into 3D\\nspace, or introduces substantial scene distortion. Cannot complete the following reasoning\\ntask. The original 2D structure is altered, leading to inaccurate grounding of the target objects.\\nData Source.\\nTo specifically assess the rotation reasoning task, we recruit some PhD-level experts\\nwith deep expertise in text-image reasoning to design the evaluation data manually, followed by the\\nnecessary review process, as mentioned in Section 3.2. Each question is designed following the\\nprinciple that it must involve a 2D rotation to reach the correct solution, ensuring the task genuinely\\nprobes rotational understanding rather than simple visual matching. Moreover, we sample data from\\nthe 2DRotation subset from the SpatialViz-Bench [66], and reformulate the question into instructions\\nfor the video models.\\nExample and Analysis.\\nThe results are shown in Figure 12. In case I, we find that Veo-3 handles\\nsmall-angle rotations and simple planar scenes reasonably well, demonstrating a basic grasp of\\nrotational motion. However, in more complex scenarios like cases II, III, and IV, the model often\\nignores the 2D rotation constraint and inadvertently alters the 3D structure, resulting in incorrect\\nrotations and degraded spatial grounding. Such errors frequently propagate to downstream tasks, such\\nas OCR in case III, or object localization in case II, due to inconsistencies in post-rotation alignment.\\nThese observations suggest that the reasoning behavior of Veo-3 remains more pattern-driven rather\\nthan principle-driven. However, as it demonstrates a partial understanding of planar rotation, this can\\nto some extent facilitate subsequent reasoning tasks.\\nTakeaway 8\\nVeo-3 exhibits only a superficial understanding of rotation reasoning. While it can approximate\\nsmall planar rotations, it fails to preserve geometric consistency under larger or compound\\ntransformations.\\n2.9\\nTable and Chart Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nThe table and chart reasoning task requires the model\\nto identify and focus on the key elements within visualizations or tabular data. For evaluation, we\\nfurther consider how effectively the model identifies the regions relevant to the query and whether\\nit can transition smoothly and visually coherently to these areas, preserving clarity, continuity, and\\nproper scaling.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe rate the performance according to the following criteria:\\n✓Good: Camera precisely focuses on the correct chart or table segment, smoothly high-\\nlighting or zooming into the queried data (e.g., correct year, category, or value). Motion is\\ncontinuous, the chart and table remain clear, and no distortion or overexposure occurs.\\n~ Moderate: Camera approximately focuses on the right region but partially misses boundaries,\\nintroduces slight blur, or transitions abruptly. Data can still be inferred.\\n✗Bad: Video fails to locate the correct region or changes the chart or table geometry\\nunnaturally. Motion jitter, scaling errors, or artifacts make data unreadable or misleading.\\n19'),\n",

It comprises 59 curated entries and\\ninstruction prompts spanning 12 diverse reasoning categories. The key statistics of MME-COF and\\nits overall composition are summarized in Table 1, Figure 2b and Figure 19.\\nReview Process.\\nFollowing the prompt design protocol in Section 2.1, all prompts undergo a\\ntwo-stage review process. In the cross-validation phase, each prompt was independently reviewed by\\nanother expert to ensure semantic clarity, alignment with the intended reasoning task, and the absence\\nof linguistic bias. In the final adjudication phase, discrepancies were jointly discussed and resolved\\nthrough consensus. This multi-step procedure ensured that every prompt was conceptually precise,\\nvisually grounded, and fully aligned with the evaluation objectives of MME-COF.\\n3.3\\nEvaluation Protocol\\nModels and Generation Settings.\\nWe evaluate the leading video models in a zero-shot setting,\\nincluding Kling-v1 [38], Seedance-1.0-pro [19], Veo-3.0-preview [70], Veo-3.0-fast [70], Sora-2 [56],\\nSora-2-pro [56]. Each model generates six video samples per prompt, and final scores were computed\\nas the mean across all samples. All videos are generated at a 16:9 aspect ratio. We adopt the\\ndefault 8-second duration for the Sora and Veo series, while retaining the default 5-second length for\\nKling and Seedance. Note that, since most video models apply automated safety filters and content\\nmoderation, which may block sensitive content, we exclude videos that are suppressed by such filters\\nfrom our evaluation.\\nEvaluation Metrics.\\nWe employ Gemini-2.5-Pro [12] as an automatic verifier to evaluate each\\ngenerated video. Gemini is prompted with the following evaluation criteria and returns structured\\nscores between 0 and 4, where higher values indicate better performance:\\n1) Instruction Alignment (0-4): Measures how well the video follows the described structure\\nand sequence in the prompt. A high score indicates that the visual steps faithfully reflect\\nthe textual instructions.\\n2) Temporal Consistency (0-4): Evaluates the smoothness and continuity between frames.\\nDisjointed or abrupt transitions will lead to a lower score.\\n28'),\n",

For video understanding methods, earlier approaches, such as MViT [14],\\nVideo Swin Transformer [48], and VideoMAE [62], aim to learn a robust representation that fosters\\ndownstream tasks. With the rise of LLMs, recent approaches encode videos as tokens and exploit the\\nlanguage backbone for captioning [61], event localization [59], and high-level reasoning [28, 83].\\nVideo generation models have also attracted much attention. Closed system, including OpenAI’s\\nSora [55, 56], Runway’s Gen-3 [58], Pika Labs [57], Luma AI [50], and Google DeepMind’s\\nVeo series [20, 21], have exhibited impressive results. However, they remain inaccessible due to\\ntheir closed-source nature. Open-source alternatives have recently become available: Stable Video\\nDiffusion [6] introduces efficient training strategies, Hunyan-Video [37] proposes systematic scaling,\\nand Wan-2.1 [64] presents an efficient 3D VAE with expanded pipelines.\\nReasoning with Video.\\nThe advent of large reasoning models [24, 60, 27, 69], such as OpenAI\\no1 [54] and DeepSeek-R1 [23], has spurred the development of video reasoning benchmarks. Most\\ncurrent methods [15, 44, 53] employ MLLMs specialized in video reasoning understanding. For\\nexample, Video-R1 [15] specifically targets temporal reasoning capabilities by introducing a temporal\\ngroup relative policy optimization (GRPO) loss. VideoChat-R1 [44] focuses on spatio-temporal\\nreasoning abilities by training with GRPO and rule-based rewards. A two-stage training strategy,\\ncombining SFT and RL, is used by VideoRFT [65]. When trained on vast collections of images\\nand videos, this strategy boosts the model’s ability to handle QA tasks, whether in general con-\\ntexts or reasoning-focused ones. These methods primarily focus on enhancing specific types of\\nquestion-answering or captioning tasks. Concurrently, [70] demonstrates the large potential of video\\ngenerative models in video reasoning. These models have implicitly acquired world knowledge\\nthroughdemonstrates impressive performance on various tasks, includinging and reasoning capability.\\nYet, this direction has rarely been explored and only experimented with in zero-shot settings.\\nEvaluation of Video Models as Zero Shot Learner.\\nRecently, several works have been exploring\\nthe zero-shot capability of video generation models in various domains, including general-purpose\\nvision understanding [70, 17], medical imaging [39], and world models [68]. [70] conducts experi-\\nments on Veo 3 with a variety of vision tasks that have not been explicitly included during training.\\nThe video model showcases surprising performance on multiple tasks like object segmentation, image\\nediting, and even maze solving. [39] later adopts a similar paradigm to medical images understanding\\ntasks and finds video generation models also show powerful capabilities, e.g., delineation of anatomi-\\ncal structures in CT scans, medical image segmentation, and even forecasting of future 3D CT phases.\\nBesides, [68] shows that video generation models could also understand complex temporal causality\\nand world knowledge in the real world, thereby serving as a world model [2, 33].\\n5\\nConclusions and Insights\\nVideo models demonstrate an intuitive understanding of the simple visual world.\\nRecent\\nvideo models can generate high-fidelity videos with realistic motion dynamics, suggesting that they\\nhave internalized substantial visual and structural knowledge about the world. Through qualitative\\nresults from our empirical study and quantitative results from the MME-COF benchmark, our work\\nconfirms that these models do exhibit intuitive yet local reasoning potential. This emergent behavior,\\nwhich aligns with the “Chain-of-Frame” (CoF) mechanism, is revealed across several common\\nsuccess patterns. (i) Fine-grained Grounding. Models demonstrate a capability for fine-grained\\nattribute and spatial grounding, especially when targets are visually distinct, as presented in visual\\ndetail reasoning tasks. (ii) Short-horizon Trace Consistency. In Visual Trace Reasoning tasks,\\nmodels can maintain short-term consistency in visual traces. (iii) Emergent Tool-Use Simulation.\\nAn emergent ability to follow CoF instructions that mimic tool-use is presented, such as drawing\\nlines in 2D geometry, highlighting targets in object counting, or controlling the camera in table\\nand chart reasoning. (iv) Foundational Spatial and Geometric Grasp. This includes single-step 3D\\ngeometry transformations, understanding basic real-world spatial layouts, finding coherent sequential\\npaths, and handling small-angle Rotations.

(v) Perceptual Precision and Specialized Knowledge. This\\nweakness appears when models fail to identify small or indistinct targets in visual detail reasoning,\\ndistort data in table and chart tasks, and fail to process specialized medical imagery due to a lack of\\ndomain understanding.\\nCurrent video models are not yet ready as standalone zero-shot reasoners.\\nOverall, our findings\\nshow that current video models are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners. Strong\\ngenerative performance does not automatically imply robust reasoning during inference. The model’s\\nbehavior appears to be driven more by learning surface-level patterns and correlations rather than by\\ninternalizing general principles. It excels at short-term coherence rather than long-horizon causality.\\nThis is evident when the model prioritizes visual plausibility over precise spatial reasoning, or favors\\nvisually symmetric patterns over strictly adhering to geometric instructions. This tendency to produce\\nplausible but instructionally flawed outputs reveals a reasoning process that is pattern-driven, not\\nprinciple-driven, thereby undermining its ability to function as a standalone zero-shot reasoner.\\nThe potential in advancing next-generation collaborative visual reasoning.\\nDespite these\\nlimitations, the emergent behaviors observed in video models signal strong potential. The CoF\\nconcept suggests a novel modality for reasoning through visual problems step by step. While these\\nmodels are not yet robust standalone reasoners, their foundational capabilities demonstrate that they\\ncan be guided through carefully designed prompts. This suggests a path where video models exhibit\\nencouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\\nReferences\\n[1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni\\nAleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al.

Immutable\\nheterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as\\nparticipating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This\\nleads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,\\nconsequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all\\nagents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training\\ncost.

It introduces a negotiator\\nduring training to derive the common representation from the local\\nrepresentations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent\\ndomain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual\\ntransformation of features between the local representation space and the\\ncommon representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To\\nbetter align local representations to the common representation containing\\nmultimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic\\nalignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the\\ntraining.

Beyond real-\\nistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception,\\nmodeling, and manipulation [70]. Yet, an important question still remains: Are\\nvideo models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning\\nscenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively\\ninvestigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3 [21]. We\\nevaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric,\\nphysical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its\\nstrengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation\\ndata into MME-COF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough\\nassessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our findings reveal that while\\ncurrent video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon\\nspatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they\\nremain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and\\nabstract logic. Overall, they are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners,\\nbut exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated\\nreasoning models.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nVideo models [21, 63, 55, 81, 11], including text-to-video and video-to-text generation models, have\\nmade rapid progress in recent years. Thanks to advances in diffusion [75, 7, 84] and autoregressive [36,\\n76, 16] architectures, current video models can produce high-fidelity videos maintaining consistent\\nobject relations and realistic motion dynamics across frames. This suggests that the models may\\nhave internalized substantial visual and structural knowledge about the world. Recent research from\\nGoogle [70] further hints that, such models are evolving beyond pure content generation: Veo-3 [21]\\nhas been shown to perform dozens of distinct vision tasks across perception, modeling, manipulation,\\nand reasoning, without any task-specific training. These emergent capabilities have led researchers to\\nposit that video models could serve as unified, generalist vision models, much like large language\\nmodels (LLMs) [1, 13, 3, 30] have become foundation models for natural language.\\nCrucially, the sequential nature of video generation provides a new perspective on how such models\\nmight reason. Each generated frame builds upon the last, creating a temporal chain of information\\npropagation. This has been dubbed “Chain-of-Frame” (CoF) reasoning [70], an analogy to the chain-\\nof-thought (CoT) process in LLMs [69, 35, 82, 23, 79] and their multi-modal variants (MLLMs) [12,\\n4, 40, 31, 10]. In essence, as a video model generates a sequence of frames, it can iteratively refine\\nand update the scene, thereby working through a problem step-by-step in time and space. This CoF\\nconcept suggests that, beyond surface-level pattern generation, general-purpose visual reasoning may\\nemerge from video generative models.\\narXiv:2510.26802v1  [cs.CV]  30 Oct 2025\\n\\x0cEmbodied\\nReasoning\\n3D Geometry\\nReasoning\\nReal-world Spatial\\nReasoning\\nPhysics-based\\nReasoning\\n2D Geometry\\nReasoning\\nTable and Chart\\nReasoning\\nObject Counting\\nReasoning\\nRotation\\nReasoning\\nVisual Detail\\nReasoning\\nVisual Trace\\nReasoning\\nGUI\\nReasoning\\nMedical\\nReasoning\\nVeo\\nSora\\nSeedance\\nVideo Models\\n...\\nZero-shot Reasoning?\\nKling\\nFigure 1: Overview of Our Study on the Reasoning Potential of Video Models. We investigate\\nwhether state-of-the-art video models exhibit emergent reasoning potentials beyond content synthesis.\\nThe analysis spans 12 reasoning dimensions under a unified perspective, exploring whether large-scale\\nvideo models can serve as zero-shot visual reasoners via CoF reasoning.\\nHowever, it remains unclear to what extent current video models truly exhibit reasoning about the\\ncontent they create. Strong generative performance does not automatically imply robust reasoning\\npotential. Emerging evidence [22, 47, 5, 78] shows that a model may produce coherent videos by\\nlearning surface-level patterns in the training data, rather than by internalizing general principles. For\\ninstance, a video model can maintain object continuity yet fail to grasp physical plausibility across\\na long sequence, or it may mimic observed visual sequences without understanding the underlying\\ncause-and-effect relationships. This motivates our central question: Are video models, purely through\\nlarge-scale visual learning, obtain the zero-shot reasoning potential?\\nTo this end, we present the first empirical study to systematically probe the CoF reasoning capabili-\\nties of modern video models, spanning 12 dimensions such as spatial, geometric, physical, temporal,\\nand embodied logic, as detailed in 1. We carry out our analysis on Veo-3, which has been system-\\natically examined as a zero-shot learner in prior work [70]. Our preliminary observations suggest\\nthat current leading video models exhibit comparable reasoning patterns, making Veo-3 a represen-\\ntative choice. Our analysis builds on reasoning scenarios distilled from diverse reasoning-oriented\\nbenchmarks [25, 67, 45, 71, 29, 34], as well as those we design ourselves, providing a compact yet\\nexpressive foundation. The prompts for video models are meticulously crafted by transforming the\\nunderlying, textual reasoning process of problem-solving into a clear, video-presentation format.\\nEach case receives a qualitative assessment across three performance levels, i.e., good, moderate, and\\nbad, complemented by a quantitative success rate to measure robustness.\\nTo standardize evaluation, we curate these tasks into the MME-COF benchmark, as illustrated in\\nFigure 2 and Section 3.2. Leveraging this benchmark, we measure several state-of-the-art video\\nmodels, i.e., Veo-3 [21], Sora-2 [56], Kling [38], and Seedance [19], to obtain directly comparable\\nscores and qualitative behaviors across categories.

Overall, current\\nvideo models are not yet ready as standalone zero-shot reasoners. Still, they show encouraging signs\\nof emergent reasoning, suggesting strong potential as complementary reasoning agents alongside\\nspecialized models.\\nOur main contributions are summarized as follows:\\n• A Comprehensive Empirical Study. We provide the first investigation of video models\\n(Veo-3) to analyze their visual reasoning potential, detailing representative successes, char-\\nacteristic errors, and the conditions under which CoF reasoning emerges, holds, or breaks.\\n• The MME-COF Benchmark. We curate MME-COF, a compact benchmark providing a\\nstandardized taxonomy and an evaluation protocol aligned with CoF reasoning, enabling\\nconsistent and category-wise assessment beyond surface-level visual fidelity.\\n• Insights and Directions. We summarize common success patterns (e.g., short-horizon\\ncoherence and stable spatial layout) and failure patterns (e.g., long-horizon degradation,\\nviolations of basic geometry/physics, and temporal logic), making clear when the behavior\\nreflects genuine reasoning versus pattern replay.\\n2\\nDeep-Dive Analysis on Veo-3\\n2.1\\nOverview\\nTo ensure a rigorous empirical study, we detail our core methodology in this section, including the\\ntaxonomy of reasoning tasks, test case curation process, the standardized style for prompt design,\\nand the analysis setup.\\nTask Taxonomy.\\nTo capture different dimensions of reasoning, our study starts from dozens of\\nreasoning-oriented tasks, which can be organized into the following 12 categories:\\n3\\n\\x0c1) Visual Detail Reasoning\\n2) Visual Trace Reasoning\\n3) Real-world Spatial Reasoning\\n4) 3D Geometry Reasoning\\n5) 2D Geometry Reasoning\\n6) Physics-based Reasoning\\n7) Rotation Reasoning\\n8) Table and Chart Reasoning\\n9) Object Counting Reasoning\\n10) GUI Reasoning\\n11) Embodied Reasoning\\n12) Medical Reasoning\\nEach category comprises several representative cases selected to test specific aspects of reasoning.\\nTest Case Curation.\\nWe recruit five PhD-level experts with deep expertise in text-image reasoning,\\nwho are tasked with selecting representative cases from benchmarks [25, 67, 45, 52, 74] corresponding\\nto each task category. For each reasoning case, the experts manually constructed text prompts that\\nexplicitly or unambiguously define the target reasoning objective, aiming to evaluate the potential of\\nvideo models for multi-modal reasoning.\\nPrompt Design Style.\\nTo ensure consistency and fairness, all prompts follow a unified style\\nemphasizing explicit visual constraints, controlled motion, and minimal linguistic ambiguity. Prompts\\nare encouraged to be written in imperative form and designed to reduce variance from language\\ninterpretation, focusing the model’s behavior on the intended visual reasoning objective. The overall\\ndesign principles are as follows:\\n1) Static camera and fixed viewpoint, unless motion is explicitly required by the task.\\n2) Stable spatial composition, consistent framing, and unchanging scene layout across\\nframes.\\n3) Clear specification of allowed and disallowed changes (e.g., “no zoom, no pan, no dolly”)\\nto constrain camera dynamics.\\n4) Explicit temporal phrasing to control the pace of motion, using cues such as “instantly”,\\n“smoothly”, or “step-by-step”.\\n5) Avoidance of direct textual hints toward the answer; instructions are purely visual and\\ntask-oriented.\\n6) Inclusion of realistic phrasing and scene context to align with the model’s natural video\\npriors while minimizing artifacts.\\nThe standardized prompt style ensures that differences in output primarily reflect the model’s internal\\nreasoning potential rather than prompt variability.\\nAnalysis Setup.\\nFor every reasoning case, we construct a text prompt that explicitly or implicitly\\nspecifies the target reasoning objective. Each prompt produces six video samples at a resolution of\\n1280×720, 24 FPS, and a duration of 8 seconds. All experiments are conducted in a unified zero-shot\\nsetup without fine-tuning, additional supervision, or auxiliary tools.\\nWe evaluate model outputs through qualitative judgments along three levels of performance, i.e.,\\nGood , Moderate , and Bad, based on the clarity, correctness, and temporal stability of the visual\\nreasoning process. Detailed definitions and examples of these evaluation criteria are provided in the\\ncorresponding task subsections. Note that, since we observe that most video models struggle to follow\\nthe requirement of ‘static shot’ reliably, we apply more permissive qualitative criteria for static-shot\\nevaluations. We further define a success rate to measure robustness across generations for each case,\\ncomputed as the proportion of successful samples among the six generated. For cases categorized as\\nBad, the success rate is always 0. Non-zero success rates only appear in cases evaluated as Good or\\nModerate , indicating that Veo-3 exhibits some potential to perform as a visual reasoner. A higher\\nsuccess rate reflects a more stable reasoning capability of the model.\\n4\\n\\x0cInput Image:\\nReasoning Video:\\nZoom in on the black bag with the Apple logo to focus on the \\nlogo\\'s color.

It illustrates Veo-3’s ability to localize\\ntargets and maintain fine-grained visual attributes across frames, together with common failure modes\\nwhen targets are small, occluded, or embedded in clutter.\\n5\\n\\x0c2.2\\nVisual Detail Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nIn the visual detail reasoning category, the objective is\\nto assess a model’s ability to discern and maintain fine-grained visual attributes and spatial relations\\nwithin generated video sequences. It covers attribute recognition, e.g., identifying color, texture or\\nmaterial of an object, and spatial relation identification, e.g., recognizing that one object is on the\\nleft of or behind another object. The model is evaluated on the capacity both to attend to the correct\\ntarget region and to maintain visual consistency, across frames, of the attribute or relation in question.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe define the three-level evaluation criteria as follows:\\n✓Good: The reasoning video accurately centers on the correct target region, clearly resolves\\nthe relevant attribute, such as color, texture or position, and maintains sharp, stable and natural\\nrendering throughout the sequence. There are no visible frame drops, artifacts or unintended\\nmotion.\\n~ Moderate: The region of interest is approximately correct, and the attribute remains\\ninferable, but the sequence suffers from minor blur, incomplete framing, slight instability\\nmild unnatural motion, or sometimes deviates from the textual instruction and produces a\\nplausible but unaligned or self-directed visual interpretation, limiting confident interpretation.\\n✗Bad: The target region is incorrect or ambiguous, the attribute cannot be reliably inferred,\\nor the video exhibits severe artifacts: abrupt frame jumps, major jitter, unintended zoom or\\ncrop, extraneous objects interfering, or conspicuous quality degradation that obstructs the\\nreasoning task altogether.\\nData Source.\\nWe sample data from the V∗Bench [71], which provides a comprehensive set of\\nevaluation dimensions including spatial relationship and color/attribute consistency tasks.\\nExample and Analysis.\\nWe illustrate typical behaviors of Veo-3 in visual detail reasoning through\\nfour representative cases in Figure 3. In case I, the model performs well in localizing the target:\\nalthough it does not strictly execute the “zoom in” instruction, it instead achieves an equivalent\\nvisual outcome through a semantically consistent motion with a person’s hand. This slight deviation\\nsuggests that the model may exhibit certain generation preferences in how it interprets and realizes\\nspatial instructions, possibly reflecting stylistic tendencies learned from training data. In cases II\\nand III, the model achieves better success rates when the targets are visually salient and contextually\\ndistinct. For the handbag and dog-motorcycle scenes, Veo-3 attends to the correct regions and\\nmaintains smooth temporal coherence. However, when the object (e.g., the motorcycle) is small or\\nsurrounded by distracting elements, the model occasionally fails to locate it accurately, indicating\\nlimited fine-grained spatial discrimination in cluttered scenes. In case IV, when the target object is\\ntiny and visually indistinct, Veo-3 cannot identify it even with explicit positional hints, highlighting\\nthat the model’s perceptual grounding and reasoning weaken sharply when object size and salience\\nare too low for reliable attention.\\nTakeaway 1\\nVeo-3 performs well in fine-grained attribute and spatial reasoning for salient, well-grounded\\ntargets, but fails when objects are small, occluded, or cluttered. It sometimes exhibits stylistic\\ngeneration biases that lead to plausible yet instruction-divergent outcomes.\\n2.3\\nVisual Trace Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nThe visual trace reasoning category evaluates a model’s\\nability to represent and maintain causal continuity across sequential actions.

The sequence shows abrupt jumps,\\ninconsistent object trajectories, or goal confusion, breaking the temporal and causal coherence\\nof the reasoning process.\\nData Source.\\nWe select samples from MVoT [41], FrozenLake [8, 72], MiniBehavior [32], RBench-\\nV [25], SpatialViz-Bench [66], and OmniSpatial [29], which provide controlled multi-step envi-\\nronments for evaluating temporal reasoning, sequential planning, and causal continuity in visual\\nsimulations.\\n8\\n\\x0cExample and Analysis.\\nIn Figure 4 and Figure 5, we showcase six representative visual-trace\\nexamples. In case I, the model repeatedly fails to execute the exact step sequence and instead drifts\\ntoward a visually salient central cell. However, case II is one of the few successes: the model can\\nproduce a coherent step-by-step path in simple, low-branching settings, but this behavior is not\\nrobust across trials. Case III largely fails, where the model often does not ground the specified object\\n(printer), sometimes hallucinating its appearance or placement rather than performing a consistent\\npickup-and-place. Case IV shows near-uniform failure on long-horizon, highly branched navigation:\\noutputs contain wrong turns, discontinuities, and no faithful global plan. Case V reveals difficulty\\ngrounding abstract movement rules, producing inconsistent arrow trajectories. Case VI produces\\nvisually plausible motions along individual paths but fails to preserve or present the comparative\\ninformation required for contrastive reasoning. Taken together, these examples indicate that the\\nmodel can simulate locally coherent short traces but systematically fails at long-horizon planning,\\nrule-grounded execution, and object-persistent manipulations.\\nTakeaway 2\\nVeo-3 can produce locally coherent, short-horizon trace animations in simple, low-branching\\nscenarios, but it does not reliably execute long-horizon plans or rule-grounded sequences.\\n2.4\\nReal-World Spatial Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nThis task investigates Veo-3 [21]’s ability to perceive\\nand maintain spatial relations within natural scenes, with a focus on reasoning about viewpoint change,\\norientation consistency, and reference-frame alignment. We assess whether the model preserves a\\nstable global coordinate frame and coherent scene orientation under varying viewpoints, and whether\\nobjects retain correct relative positions and orientations with respect to each other across different\\nviews.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe define the evaluation criteria in three levels:\\n✓Good: Scene orientation, reference frame, and viewpoint are consistent and correctly\\nrepresent spatial relations. The camera remains steady and the motion is natural.\\n~ Moderate: Scene roughly matches the instruction but contains small perspective errors,\\nunnatural transitions, or partial mirroring. Motion remains interpretable but not physically\\ncoherent.\\n✗Bad: Reference frame or direction is wrong; viewpoint shifts abruptly or inconsistently.\\nVideo suffers from strong camera drift, disorienting motion, or spatial chaos.\\nData Source.\\nTo evaluate on orientation and layout reasoning, we specifically sample data from\\nMMSI-Bench [74]. Also, the tasks of perspective taking and spatial interaction are selected from the\\nOmniSpatial dataset [29].\\nExample and Analysis.\\nAs shown in Figure 6, Veo-3 can correctly handle basic spatial layouts\\nin case I, but struggles with complex viewpoints or orientation changes in case II. The perspective\\ntransformations are sometimes inaccurate or even incorrect, suggesting that the model tends to\\nprioritize visual plausibility over precise spatial reasoning, which hinders further reasoning in case IV.\\nMoreover, case III demonstrates that Veo-3 has difficulty understanding depth, further limiting its\\nspatial reasoning capability.\\nTakeaway 3\\nWhile Veo-3 exhibits an emerging ability for simple real-world spatial reasoning, its capability\\nremains insufficient for handling more complex spatial understanding tasks.\\n9\\n\\x0cInput Image:\\nReasoning Video:\\n✓Good\\nSuccess Rate: 33%\\nI.

The assessment focuses on three key dimensions: geometric accuracy,\\nstructural completeness throughout the transformation, and visual continuity across frames.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe categorize the model’s performance into three levels:\\n✓Good: Transformations like folding, rotation and assembly are geometrically correct,\\nvisually smooth, and continuous, maintaining structural integrity and realistic motion. No\\nbroken edges, jumps, or spatial artifacts.\\n~ Moderate: Transformations are partially correct but show local misalignment, unrealistic\\ndeformation, or discontinuous motion; geometry is roughly interpretable but imperfect.\\n✗Bad: Transformation fails. For example, wrong fold, structure collapse, or impossible\\ngeometry. Motion is erratic, discontinuous, or visually implausible, breaking the sense of\\nphysical realism.\\nData Source.\\nTo construct diverse and representative evaluation data, we adapt tasks from estab-\\nlished geometric spatial reasoning datasets, including the 3D-Text-Instruct and Folding Nets subsets\\nof the STARE benchmark [43], the BlockMoving subset from the SpatialViz-Bench [66], as well as\\nVisuLogic [73] benchmark.\\nExample and Analysis.\\nWe showcase the results of Veo-3 on 3D geometry reasoning tasks\\nin Figure 7 and Figure 8. Veo-3 demonstrates a degree of potential on 3D geometry reasoning,\\nperforming reasonably well on simple, single-step geometric transformations, as shown in case I.\\nHowever, its performance degrades noticeably when facing multi-step or compositionally complex\\ntransformations in case II. As presented in cases III and V, the model frequently produces misaligned\\nor self-intersecting structures, leading to a loss of geometric consistency. Further observations in case\\nIV, show that while the model can partially understand the geometric shape of individual objects, it\\nlacks a coherent understanding of coordinate systems and the spatial relationships among multiple\\nobjects.\\nTakeaway 4\\nVeo-3 exhibits emerging reasoning potential on basic 3D transformations but breaks down on\\ncomplex or multi-step geometry, often yielding misaligned or self-intersecting structures. Its\\n12\\n\\x0cTakeaway 5\\n3D geometric reasoning remains fragile, revealing substantial gaps in its ability to function as a\\nreliable 3D geometry reasoner.\\n2.6\\n2D Geometry Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nTo assess a model’s competence in 2D geometric\\nreasoning, we evaluate its zero-shot performance on planar geometric construction tasks. These\\ntasks involve drawing geometric relations by connecting points, adding auxiliary lines, and moving\\ngeometric shapes. The evaluation focuses on whether the generated constructions or movements\\naccurately reflect the described geometric relationships and adhere to the given instructions, while\\nmaintaining smooth, stable operations that ensure visual clarity and coherence throughout the process.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe rate the performance according to the following criteria:\\n✓Good: Constructions and movements are geometrically accurate and visually smooth.\\nEndpoints, intersections, angles, and motion trajectories align correctly with the instructions.\\nBoth drawing and movement processes are stable, fluid, and natural, resembling human\\nsketching or manipulation.\\n~ Moderate: Constructions and movements roughly follow the intended geometry but exhibit\\nminor inaccuracies in line placement, shape alignment, trajectory, or smoothness. Some local\\njitter or abrupt motion may appear, but the overall structure and motion remain interpretable.\\n✗Bad: Constructions or movements deviate substantially from geometric correctness. Lines\\nor shapes may be misplaced, disconnected, or moved in a chaotic or discontinuous manner\\n(e.g., jittering, overlapping, or distorted paths), leading to visual instability and loss of\\ninterpretability.\\nData Source.\\nThe evaluation data are drawn from multiple established sources, including the\\nGeo170k dataset [18], the VarsityTutors subset of Math-PUMA [85] dataset, the line-connection\\nsubset of RBench-V [25], the MAVIS-Gen [80], Tangram Puzzle subsets of the STARE [43] benchmark,\\nand data from VAT [46].\\nExample and Analysis.\\nThe representative examples of the 2D geometry reasoning task are\\npresented in Figures 9 and 10. Veo-3 demonstrates a foundational capability for simple geometric\\nconnection tasks, correctly identifying and linking elements in straightforward scenarios like in case\\nIII. However, this basic competence is inconsistent. The model often prioritizes producing visually\\nsymmetric or semantically meaningful patterns rather than strictly adhering to geometric instructions\\n(cases I and II). Furthermore, case II reveals instances where the model unintentionally modifies the\\noriginal figures, indicating a limited awareness of geometric constraints and poor spatial consistency.\\nWhen tackling more complex connection tasks, the model frequently fails to interpret the intended\\ndrawing order or point indices, resulting in incorrect connection sequences, as demonstrated in cases\\nV, VI, and VII. This is often coupled with an inability to control task termination, as the model tends\\nto continue drawing beyond the required constructions. Finally, for tasks involving the movement\\nof geometric shapes in cases IV and VIII, the model struggles to maintain geometric structural\\nconsistency throughout the motion.\\nTakeaway 6\\nVeo-3 shows initial 2D geometric reasoning ability but still falls short of consistent, constraint-\\naware geometric understanding, remaining far from a robust geometric reasoner.\\n13\\n\\x0cInput Image:\\nReasoning Video:\\nA line connecting point A and point C.

Tasks in this group involve gravity, collisions, reflection, momentum, or\\nenergy conservation, requiring the model to generate physically plausible and temporally coherent\\nmotion. Evaluation focuses on two complementary aspects: (i) physical plausibility, which means\\nwhether the simulated motion obeys common physical principles; and (ii) causal correctness, which is\\nwhether object interactions are consistent with the underlying cause-and-effect relationships described\\nin the prompt.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe rate the performance according to the following criteria:\\n✓Good: The motion sequence adheres to physical laws such as gravity, momentum, and\\nenergy conservation. Object interactions are realistic and temporally smooth, and the visual\\noutcome remains coherent and credible throughout.\\n~ Moderate: The physical relations are approximately correct but include minor inconsisten-\\ncies, such as irregular acceleration, timing mismatch, or slight violation of conservation. The\\noverall motion remains interpretable and visually plausible.\\n✗Bad: The motion is physically implausible or visually chaotic—objects float, stop abruptly,\\nor behave contrary to basic causal principles. Severe artifacts or temporal discontinuities\\ndisrupt the perception of a coherent physical process.\\nData Source.\\nWe draw samples from MMMU [77], ScienceQA [49], and related physical reasoning\\nsubsets of RBench-V [26] and SpatialViz-Bench [66], covering scenarios such as object collisions,\\npendulum motion, frictional sliding, and optical or magnetic interactions.\\nExample and Analysis.\\nFigure 11 presents four representative physics tasks and their outputs.\\nCase I shows that the model can produce a visually coherent slide, but the behavior violates basic\\nphysical laws. Case II is the most reliable, where reflections and general trajectory shape are rendered\\nplausibly and the task attains a high success rate, although small angular or timing offsets are common.\\nIn case III, the model conveys attraction through motion, yet the depicted dynamics do not reliably\\ntrack the intended force magnitudes or causal ordering. Finally, case IV exposes structural failures,\\nincorrect meshing, inconsistent relative rotations, and nonphysical contact behavior occur frequently,\\nso the mechanical constraints are not respected. Overall, the model can synthesize locally plausible\\ndynamics and handle simple reflection rules, but it fails to maintain quantitative physical constraints\\nand causal fidelity in frictional, force-driven, or mechanically constrained scenarios.\\nTakeaway 7\\nVeo-3 often generates visually plausible short-term dynamics, but it systematically fails to\\npreserve quantitative physical constraints (energy, momentum), causal ordering, and contact\\nmechanics in frictional, force-driven, or mechanically constrained scenarios.

However,\\nits foundational grasp of simple rotations signals its potential to support rotation-based reasoning\\ntasks.\\n18\\n\\x0cDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nModel outputs are categorized into three quality levels:\\n✓Good: The rotation is accurate, complete, and strictly confined to the 2D plane, with no\\nextraneous scene motion. The following reasoning tasks are completed correctly. Target\\nobjects remain precisely grounded after rotation.\\n~ Moderate: The rotation is largely correct but may be incomplete or slightly off-angle,\\nthough still confined to the 2D plane. The following reasoning tasks are mostly completed.\\nMinor temporal or visual inconsistencies may appear, but do not alter the core 2D structure or\\nobject grounding.\\n✗Bad: The model fails to perform the correct rotation, extends the transformation into 3D\\nspace, or introduces substantial scene distortion. Cannot complete the following reasoning\\ntask. The original 2D structure is altered, leading to inaccurate grounding of the target objects.\\nData Source.\\nTo specifically assess the rotation reasoning task, we recruit some PhD-level experts\\nwith deep expertise in text-image reasoning to design the evaluation data manually, followed by the\\nnecessary review process, as mentioned in Section 3.2. Each question is designed following the\\nprinciple that it must involve a 2D rotation to reach the correct solution, ensuring the task genuinely\\nprobes rotational understanding rather than simple visual matching. Moreover, we sample data from\\nthe 2DRotation subset from the SpatialViz-Bench [66], and reformulate the question into instructions\\nfor the video models.\\nExample and Analysis.\\nThe results are shown in Figure 12. In case I, we find that Veo-3 handles\\nsmall-angle rotations and simple planar scenes reasonably well, demonstrating a basic grasp of\\nrotational motion. However, in more complex scenarios like cases II, III, and IV, the model often\\nignores the 2D rotation constraint and inadvertently alters the 3D structure, resulting in incorrect\\nrotations and degraded spatial grounding. Such errors frequently propagate to downstream tasks, such\\nas OCR in case III, or object localization in case II, due to inconsistencies in post-rotation alignment.\\nThese observations suggest that the reasoning behavior of Veo-3 remains more pattern-driven rather\\nthan principle-driven. However, as it demonstrates a partial understanding of planar rotation, this can\\nto some extent facilitate subsequent reasoning tasks.\\nTakeaway 8\\nVeo-3 exhibits only a superficial understanding of rotation reasoning. While it can approximate\\nsmall planar rotations, it fails to preserve geometric consistency under larger or compound\\ntransformations.\\n2.9\\nTable and Chart Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nThe table and chart reasoning task requires the model\\nto identify and focus on the key elements within visualizations or tabular data. For evaluation, we\\nfurther consider how effectively the model identifies the regions relevant to the query and whether\\nit can transition smoothly and visually coherently to these areas, preserving clarity, continuity, and\\nproper scaling.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe rate the performance according to the following criteria:\\n✓Good: Camera precisely focuses on the correct chart or table segment, smoothly high-\\nlighting or zooming into the queried data (e.g., correct year, category, or value). Motion is\\ncontinuous, the chart and table remain clear, and no distortion or overexposure occurs.\\n~ Moderate: Camera approximately focuses on the right region but partially misses boundaries,\\nintroduces slight blur, or transitions abruptly. Data can still be inferred.\\n✗Bad: Video fails to locate the correct region or changes the chart or table geometry\\nunnaturally. Motion jitter, scaling errors, or artifacts make data unreadable or misleading.\\n19\\n\\x0cInput Image:\\nReasoning Video:\\nStart with smoothly zooming in to focus on the \\'Nova Scotia\\' row.

Veo-3 demonstrates an initial ability\\nto focus on relevant data regions but lacks the precision and consistency required for reliable visual\\nanalysis.\\n20\\n\\x0cData Source.\\nWe use samples from the ChartQA [52] dataset and TableVQA-Bench [34].\\nExample and Analysis.\\nFor charts, as presented in cases I, II and III in Figure 13, Veo-3 can often\\nzoom into an approximately correct region but lacks the precision needed to accurately locate the\\nqueried data. For tables, as shown in case IV, Veo-3 fails to correctly identify the required element\\nand tends to select entries randomly. The model also frequently adds, modifies, or distorts existing\\nchart and table elements, resulting in visual inconsistencies that undermine the accuracy of chart\\ninterpretation.\\nTakeaway 9\\nVeo-3 demonstrates emerging competence and potential in structured visual understanding, but\\nstill falls short of functioning as a precise and reliable chart-table reasoner.\\n2.10\\nObject Counting Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nIn this category, we focus on the ability to accurately\\nenumerate objects within a 2D or 3D scene. In each instance, the model is required to identify, ground,\\nand count target objects, typically by highlighting, drawing bounding boxes, applying numerical\\nlabels, or panning. The evaluation focuses on the accuracy of the count and the precision of the\\nspatial grounding, performed within a scene that remains static or experiences only minimal motion,\\nensuring the counting process is not influenced.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nModel outputs are categorized into three quality levels:\\n✓Good: The model precisely highlights, draws bounding boxes around, or labels the objects\\nwith correct numbers, and performs smooth and controlled panning when necessary to cover\\nall targets. Motion is continuous, and the scene remains static or experiences only slight\\nchanges that do not influence the counting process.\\n~ Moderate: The model approximately highlights or draws bounding boxes around the objects,\\nor performs panning with minor instability or incomplete coverage. Objects or the scene may\\nmove or change slightly, but this does not strongly affect the counting process.\\n✗Bad: The model fails to correctly highlight, label, or draw bounding boxes around the\\nobjects, or pans erratically such that parts of the scene are missed or revisited unnecessarily.\\nObjects or the scene move or change substantially, severely affecting the counting process.\\nData Source.\\nThe 2D object counting data are sampled from the counting subset of RBench-V [25].\\nThe 3D object counting data are from the Super-CLEVER dataset [45] and VAT [46].\\nExample and Analysis.\\nThe results are shown in Figures 14 and 15. In the 2D counting tasks from\\ncases I to III, objects frequently move or change during the process, negatively impacting counting\\nstability and accuracy. In the 3D counting tasks, Veo-3 successfully handles simple grounding and\\ncounting scenarios, as demonstrated in case V, but struggles with scenes involving complex materials\\nor geometric variations in cases VI and VII, leading to inaccurate counts. Additionally, in the panning\\nprocess of case VII, the camera fails to precisely move to the regions containing all target objects,\\nfurther hindering the counting process.\\nTakeaway 10\\nVeo-3 demonstrates basic counting capability but lacks the spatial control and robustness\\nrequired for reliable object enumeration in dynamic or complex scenes.\\n21\\n\\x0ccropped_0.jpg\\nInput Image:\\nReasoning Video:\\nA scanner dot moves along the black line from bottom-left to top-right.

In each instance, the model is\\nrequired to perform actions, such as clicking on specific UI elements. The evaluation focuses on the\\naccuracy of the click and the temporal coherence of the interaction, ensuring the scene and irrelevant\\nUI elements remain consistent.\\nDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe define the evaluation criteria in three levels:\\n✓Good: The click is precise, with no extraneous actions. No superfluous icons appear, and\\nthe original data and icons remain unchanged.\\n~ Moderate: The click is precise but may be accompanied by minor extraneous actions.\\nSuperfluous icons might appear but do not obscure the click target, and original data or icons\\nshow only slight alterations.\\n22\\n\\x0ccropped_0.jpg\\nInput Image:\\nReasoning Video:\\nDraw bounding boxes around the brown metal mountain bikes to the right of \\nthe origami crane.

It involves recognizing both static\\nand dynamic affordances, as well as identifying manipulation-relevant object and scene attributes.\\nEvaluation focuses on two aspects: (i) the generation of stable and contextually relevant visual\\nsequences, and (ii) the maintenance of reasoning fidelity without resorting to implausible planning\\nshortcuts or hallucinated interactions.\\n25\\n\\x0cDefinition of Good / Moderate / Bad.\\nWe define the evaluation criteria in three levels:\\n✓Good: The sweep/framing covers all candidates fairly (equal or near-equal dwell), centers\\nthe manipulation-relevant geometry (e.g., handle + frame/gap, lid-body interface, hinge side)\\nwith crisp focus and stable scale; no cropping of key context; no content alterations.\\n~ Moderate: The view roughly includes the right region(s) but with minor bias or coverage\\nissues: slight off-center, brief under-exposure of one candidate, small motion jitter, or shallow\\ncontext (still enough to infer).\\n✗Bad: The camera misses or biases the evidence (e.g., lingers only on one point, crops\\naway the hinge/rail, over-zooms a non-relevant patch), introduces distortion/content edits, or\\nproduces footage from which a fair decision cannot be made.\\nData Source.\\nWe select samples from Robobench [51] for the analysis. In addition to a general\\nunderstanding of static attributes, we also sample data to assess whether Veo-3 can perform direct\\nreasoning on tasks involving the generation of static and dynamic affordances.\\nExample and Analysis.\\nAs shown in Figure 17, Veo-3 demonstrates the ability to comprehend\\nobjects within real-world scenes. However, its capacity for assisting visual reasoning in embodied\\nscenarios remains constrained by insufficient stability. As illustrated in case I, when provided with a\\nclearly defined object for manipulation, Veo-3 is capable of generating plausible manipulation affor-\\ndances. When it comes to dynamic affordances, Veo-3 tends to employ workarounds to compensate\\nfor its planning deficiencies, as evidenced in case II, where it generated a new cucumber instead of\\nthe intended object. With respect to static attributes, Veo-3 struggles to accurately differentiate visual\\nprompts and misidentifies the position of containers. As shown in case III, the green box, intended to\\nspecify the location of the container, inadvertently led Veo-3 to produce hallucinations.\\nTakeaway 12\\nVeo-3’s capabilities are currently limited to basic object recognition rather than true embodied\\nreasoning. It lacks the necessary planning and stability to reliably interpret and act upon\\ndynamic or spatially constrained instructions, indicating its limitations in understanding and\\nreasoning of real-world interactions.\\n2.13\\nMedical Reasoning\\nTask Description and Evaluated Aspects.\\nThis category assesses the model’s ability to localize\\nlesions or structures, identify relevant attributes (e.g., side, lobe), recognize pathological patterns\\n(e.g., “jump distribution”), and make binary decisions (e.g., presence or absence).

It comprises 59 curated entries and\\ninstruction prompts spanning 12 diverse reasoning categories. The key statistics of MME-COF and\\nits overall composition are summarized in Table 1, Figure 2b and Figure 19.\\nReview Process.\\nFollowing the prompt design protocol in Section 2.1, all prompts undergo a\\ntwo-stage review process. In the cross-validation phase, each prompt was independently reviewed by\\nanother expert to ensure semantic clarity, alignment with the intended reasoning task, and the absence\\nof linguistic bias. In the final adjudication phase, discrepancies were jointly discussed and resolved\\nthrough consensus. This multi-step procedure ensured that every prompt was conceptually precise,\\nvisually grounded, and fully aligned with the evaluation objectives of MME-COF.\\n3.3\\nEvaluation Protocol\\nModels and Generation Settings.\\nWe evaluate the leading video models in a zero-shot setting,\\nincluding Kling-v1 [38], Seedance-1.0-pro [19], Veo-3.0-preview [70], Veo-3.0-fast [70], Sora-2 [56],\\nSora-2-pro [56]. Each model generates six video samples per prompt, and final scores were computed\\nas the mean across all samples. All videos are generated at a 16:9 aspect ratio. We adopt the\\ndefault 8-second duration for the Sora and Veo series, while retaining the default 5-second length for\\nKling and Seedance. Note that, since most video models apply automated safety filters and content\\nmoderation, which may block sensitive content, we exclude videos that are suppressed by such filters\\nfrom our evaluation.\\nEvaluation Metrics.\\nWe employ Gemini-2.5-Pro [12] as an automatic verifier to evaluate each\\ngenerated video. Gemini is prompted with the following evaluation criteria and returns structured\\nscores between 0 and 4, where higher values indicate better performance:\\n1) Instruction Alignment (0-4): Measures how well the video follows the described structure\\nand sequence in the prompt.

Among the five dimensions, Visual Stability achieves the highest average,\\nindicating that current video models can generate smooth and coherent sequences. Yet, their behavior\\nremains largely at the level of pattern replay rather than genuine reasoning.\\nThe Sora-2 series [56] shows relative advantages in physics-based, embodied, and medical reason-\\ning, while the Veo-3.0 series [21] performs comparatively better in real-world spatial reasoning.\\nSeedance-1.0-pro [19] demonstrates relative strength in rotation and 3D geometry reasoning. These\\ntrends suggest that different models specialize in distinct reasoning aspects. However, their mean\\nscores remain below 2.0 out of 4, highlighting substantial room for improvement and pointing to\\nopportunities for more targeted enhancement in future development.\\n29\\n\\x0c4\\nRelated Work\\nVideo Models.\\nVideo models have been progressively evolving both in the fields of video under-\\nstanding and generation. For video understanding methods, earlier approaches, such as MViT [14],\\nVideo Swin Transformer [48], and VideoMAE [62], aim to learn a robust representation that fosters\\ndownstream tasks. With the rise of LLMs, recent approaches encode videos as tokens and exploit the\\nlanguage backbone for captioning [61], event localization [59], and high-level reasoning [28, 83].\\nVideo generation models have also attracted much attention. Closed system, including OpenAI’s\\nSora [55, 56], Runway’s Gen-3 [58], Pika Labs [57], Luma AI [50], and Google DeepMind’s\\nVeo series [20, 21], have exhibited impressive results. However, they remain inaccessible due to\\ntheir closed-source nature. Open-source alternatives have recently become available: Stable Video\\nDiffusion [6] introduces efficient training strategies, Hunyan-Video [37] proposes systematic scaling,\\nand Wan-2.1 [64] presents an efficient 3D VAE with expanded pipelines.\\nReasoning with Video.\\nThe advent of large reasoning models [24, 60, 27, 69], such as OpenAI\\no1 [54] and DeepSeek-R1 [23], has spurred the development of video reasoning benchmarks. Most\\ncurrent methods [15, 44, 53] employ MLLMs specialized in video reasoning understanding. For\\nexample, Video-R1 [15] specifically targets temporal reasoning capabilities by introducing a temporal\\ngroup relative policy optimization (GRPO) loss. VideoChat-R1 [44] focuses on spatio-temporal\\nreasoning abilities by training with GRPO and rule-based rewards. A two-stage training strategy,\\ncombining SFT and RL, is used by VideoRFT [65]. When trained on vast collections of images\\nand videos, this strategy boosts the model’s ability to handle QA tasks, whether in general con-\\ntexts or reasoning-focused ones. These methods primarily focus on enhancing specific types of\\nquestion-answering or captioning tasks. Concurrently, [70] demonstrates the large potential of video\\ngenerative models in video reasoning. These models have implicitly acquired world knowledge\\nthroughdemonstrates impressive performance on various tasks, includinging and reasoning capability.\\nYet, this direction has rarely been explored and only experimented with in zero-shot settings.\\nEvaluation of Video Models as Zero Shot Learner.\\nRecently, several works have been exploring\\nthe zero-shot capability of video generation models in various domains, including general-purpose\\nvision understanding [70, 17], medical imaging [39], and world models [68]. [70] conducts experi-\\nments on Veo 3 with a variety of vision tasks that have not been explicitly included during training.\\nThe video model showcases surprising performance on multiple tasks like object segmentation, image\\nediting, and even maze solving. [39] later adopts a similar paradigm to medical images understanding\\ntasks and finds video generation models also show powerful capabilities, e.g., delineation of anatomi-\\ncal structures in CT scans, medical image segmentation, and even forecasting of future 3D CT phases.\\nBesides, [68] shows that video generation models could also understand complex temporal causality\\nand world knowledge in the real world, thereby serving as a world model [2, 33].\\n5\\nConclusions and Insights\\nVideo models demonstrate an intuitive understanding of the simple visual world.\\nRecent\\nvideo models can generate high-fidelity videos with realistic motion dynamics, suggesting that they\\nhave internalized substantial visual and structural knowledge about the world. Through qualitative\\nresults from our empirical study and quantitative results from the MME-COF benchmark, our work\\nconfirms that these models do exhibit intuitive yet local reasoning potential. This emergent behavior,\\nwhich aligns with the “Chain-of-Frame” (CoF) mechanism, is revealed across several common\\nsuccess patterns. (i) Fine-grained Grounding. Models demonstrate a capability for fine-grained\\nattribute and spatial grounding, especially when targets are visually distinct, as presented in visual\\ndetail reasoning tasks. (ii) Short-horizon Trace Consistency. In Visual Trace Reasoning tasks,\\nmodels can maintain short-term consistency in visual traces. (iii) Emergent Tool-Use Simulation.\\nAn emergent ability to follow CoF instructions that mimic tool-use is presented, such as drawing\\nlines in 2D geometry, highlighting targets in object counting, or controlling the camera in table\\nand chart reasoning. (iv) Foundational Spatial and Geometric Grasp. This includes single-step 3D\\ngeometry transformations, understanding basic real-world spatial layouts, finding coherent sequential\\npaths, and handling small-angle Rotations. (v) Preliminary Real-world Interaction. Models display\\na preliminary comprehension of real-world interaction, generating coherent manipulation paths in\\nembodied reasoning.\\n30\\n\\x0cComplex visual reasoning reveals fundamental limitations.\\nHowever, visual reasoning demands\\nmore than these foundational skills. It tests a model’s ability to maintain long-horizon logical\\nconsistency, adhere to abstract constraints, and understand functional principles. In these complex\\nareas, our study reveals fundamental limitations and several common failure patterns. (i) Causal and\\nPhysical Logic. This is evident in physics-based reasoning, where the model generates implausible\\nmotion that violates basic causal principles, and in visual trace reasoning, where the generated\\nsequences break causal order with illogical steps. (ii) Long-horizon and Rule-grounded Reasoning.\\nIn visual trace reasoning, models fail to maintain state and adhere to task-specific rules over extended\\nsequences. (iii) Geometric and Spatial Logic. Models fail at multi-step or complex transformations\\nin 3D/2D geometry and real-world spatial tasks, often breaking constraints or prioritizing visual\\nplausibility over correctness. (iv) Functional and Interaction Logic. They merely imitate GUI actions\\nwithout grasping their purpose and lack the necessary planning and stability for reliable Embodied\\ntasks, often resorting to workarounds. (v) Perceptual Precision and Specialized Knowledge. This\\nweakness appears when models fail to identify small or indistinct targets in visual detail reasoning,\\ndistort data in table and chart tasks, and fail to process specialized medical imagery due to a lack of\\ndomain understanding.\\nCurrent video models are not yet ready as standalone zero-shot reasoners.\\nOverall, our findings\\nshow that current video models are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners. Strong\\ngenerative performance does not automatically imply robust reasoning during inference. The model’s\\nbehavior appears to be driven more by learning surface-level patterns and correlations rather than by\\ninternalizing general principles. It excels at short-term coherence rather than long-horizon causality.\\nThis is evident when the model prioritizes visual plausibility over precise spatial reasoning, or favors\\nvisually symmetric patterns over strictly adhering to geometric instructions. This tendency to produce\\nplausible but instructionally flawed outputs reveals a reasoning process that is pattern-driven, not\\nprinciple-driven, thereby undermining its ability to function as a standalone zero-shot reasoner.\\nThe potential in advancing next-generation collaborative visual reasoning.\\nDespite these\\nlimitations, the emergent behaviors observed in video models signal strong potential. The CoF\\nconcept suggests a novel modality for reasoning through visual problems step by step. While these\\nmodels are not yet robust standalone reasoners, their foundational capabilities demonstrate that they\\ncan be guided through carefully designed prompts. This suggests a path where video models exhibit\\nencouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\\nReferences\\n[1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni\\nAleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal Anadkat, et al.

      "**1. Overview & Overall Assessment of Veo-3**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Capabilities:** Veo-3 demonstrates potential in recognizing simple patterns (2D geometry) and generating visually plausible short-term dynamics (physics).\n",
      "*   **Limitations:** It consistently struggles with maintaining quantitative physical constraints (energy, momentum), causal ordering, and contact mechanics in more complex scenarios (physics).  Its outputs are good for qualitative illustration but unreliable for precise reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Detailed Task Descriptions & Evaluation Categories**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **2.1 Geometry Reasoning (2D)**\n",
      "    *   **Focus:** Assessing the ability to reason about planar object rotation and maintain consistent spatial grounding under rotation.\n",
      "    *   **Evaluation:** Based on physical plausibility and causal correctness.\n",
      "    *   **Rating System:**  Good, Moderate, or Bad (based on adherence to physical laws and causal relationships).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **2.2 Physics-based Reasoning**\n",
      "    *   **Focus:**  Modeling and predicting motion dynamics, including:\n",

      "        *   Reflection\n",

      "    *   **Evaluation:** Two key aspects:\n",
      "        *   **Physical Plausibility:**  Does the motion *look* physically reasonable?\n",
      "        *   **Causal Correctness:**  Do the object interactions follow consistent cause-and-effect relationships?\n",
      "    *   **Data Sources:** MMMU, ScienceQA, RBench-V\n",
      "    *   **Example & Analysis:** Illustrative cases highlighting strength/weakness (e.g., simple slide vs. complex interactions).\n",

      "**3.  Key Observations & Implications**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Strengths:** Veo-3 excels in generating *visually* plausible short-term motion.\n",
      "*   **Weaknesses:** The model’s failure to maintain quantitative physical constraints is a critical limitation, preventing it from being reliably used for physics-based reasoning. Small inconsistencies or artifacts can quickly snowball into unrealistic behavior.\n",

      "**4.  Structure of the Evaluation Data**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rating Levels:** Good, Moderate, Bad - provides a simple scale for assessing task performance.\n",
